# Project Tests

This repository contains all of the project tests for projects 1, 2, 3, and 4. To earn credit for the project functionality (and hence be eligible for code review), you must pass that project's test suite. Specifically:

  - **Project 1 InvertedIndex:** You must pass the test suite in `Project1Test.java`, which essentially only contains those tests included in `IndexTest.java`.

  - **Project 2 Partial Search:** You must pass the test suite in `Project2Test.java`, which contains those tests included in `IndexTest.java` and `SearchTest.java`.

  - **Project 3 Multithreading:** You must pass* the test suite in `Project3Test.java`, which contains those tests included in `IndexTest.java`, `SearchTest.java`, `ThreadTest.java`, and `StressTest.java`.

    :warning: For this project, you actually only need to pass `IndexTest.java`, `SearchTest.java`, and `ThreadTest.java` to be eligible for code review. You can fail `StressTest.java` and still sign up for code review!

  - **Project 4 Search Engine:** You must pass the test suite in `Project4Test.java` to earn credit for the core web crawler functionality.

    :warning: You must pass the web crawler test suite before moving on to the search engine functionality! If you are unable to pass these functionality tests, you will be ineligible for credit for the search engine functionality (even if you completed it).

See the main project page for details on how to setup this repository, test locally and remotely, and the project deadlines.
